## Welcome to the NASA S-MODE GitHub organization :octocat:	

The Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics and Vertical Transport Experiment (S-MODE) will test the hypothesis that submesoscale (1-10 km) ocean dynamics make important contributions to vertical exchange in the upper ocean. You can find more about S-MODE [here](http://smode.whoi.edu/)

The S-MODE GitHub organization has the goal of facilitating collaboration between the science team members and members of the broader community as well as contributing to NASA's [Open Source Science Initiative](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science-overview).
