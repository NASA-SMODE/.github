## Welcome to the NASA S-MODE GitHub organization :octocat:	

The Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics and Vertical Transport Experiment (S-MODE) is a NASA Venture Suborbital-3 mission. S-MODE will test the hypothesis that *submesoscale (1-10 km) ocean dynamics make important contributions to vertical exchange in the upper ocean*. You can find more about S-MODE [here](https://espo.nasa.gov/s-mode/content/S-MODE).

The S-MODE GitHub organization has three main goals:

1. To streamline collaborations among Science Team members.
2. To increase transparency and accessibility of S-MODE software and data.
3. To promote engagement with the broader community. 

This effort benefits from and contributes to NASA's [Open Source Science Initiative](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science-overview).
