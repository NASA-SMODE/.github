## Welcome to the NASA S-MODE GitHub organization

**What should be here?**
- [ ] A short introduction - what is this organization all about?
- [ ] General contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved? 
- [ ] Useful resources and links

Perhaps everything else should live on the [GuidesAndCheatsheets](https://github.com/NASA-SMODE/GuidesAndCheatsheets) repo:

- [ ] CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md

<!---
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
